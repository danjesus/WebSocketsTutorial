## Intro 👋

In this [tutorial](https://sahansera.dev/understanding-websockets-with-aspnetcore-5/), we will go through RFC 6455 WebSockets specification and configure a generic ASP.NET (Core) 5 application to communicate over WebSockets connection with SignalR. We will dive into the underlying concepts to understand what happens under the covers.
